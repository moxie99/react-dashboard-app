With modern material design, a fully functional dashboard, a property management page, and a users page - both connected to our database and a profile page that connects the two, this video is the updated full-stack MERN course you’ve all been waiting for.

Alongside building this application, I learnt how to use the most in-demand technologies today:

1. Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js that together form the powerful MERN stack
2. Material UI: The most popular UI Component Kit nowadays
3. TypeScript: Yep, you heard that right; we’ll be using TypeScript on this project! No previous typescript knowledge is required
4. I also learnt how to transform a Figma design into a fully functioning website
5. I also learnt how to optimize images and store them on the cloud using Cloudinary
6. Provide a quick and easy way for my users to log in and register using Google ****Auth
7. And most importantly, I have learnt learn how to build React-based CRUD applications incredibly quickly using refine.
